## About <a name = "about"></a>

This application allows the user to create a Dungeons and Dragons (D&D)-based character and determine their character class (Barbarian, Wizard, Druid, etc.), their level, and their attributes such as Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom. The user can then compare their character with a randomly generated monster and see if the odds of battle are in their favor. There is also an API to YouTube playlists that play adventure music while the user builds their character. We would like to incorperate more specific features for both the mosters and the character creation like weapons and other details.

Overall, we are satisfied with how the project came along. However, some challenges that we faced were often GitHub related. At first, we had little knowledge on how to correctly pull, push, or merge branches when certain work was behind on commits. We quickly learned workarounds and were able to efficiently finish the main portion of the project.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

When the user enters the application, they are prompted with instructions on how to correctly use the application. The user can select the 'X' button or the bottom on the bottom of the modal prompt. This prompt can be toggled again with the 'instructions' button on the top right of the page. The user is then present with a YouTube API, where they can listen to fantasy music from a predetermined playlist while they build their character. To build their character, they simply need to select values from dropdown buttons under the 'Create Your Character' section heading.  When they are finished they can press the 'Create' button that will lead them to the next page.

On the next page, the user is presented with another YouTube API, which provides battle music as the user compares their character to a randomly generated monster. On the bottom half of this page, the user will find two boxes on the left. The first box (from top to bottom) named 'Character Stats' is the user's character stats, which are determined by their previous selections on the character creation page. The second box named 'Enemy Stats' provides a button where the user can generate a random monster when they click it. The monster's stats are structured in the same manner for easy comparison. If the user look to the right of these two boxes, they can see another box called 'results'. This box is meant to display how effective the user's character would be against each monster and whether or not they would win or lose againstb them. When the user is finished comparing their character, they can click the 'Go Back' button on the top right of the page to return to the landing page, where they can create anothyer character.
